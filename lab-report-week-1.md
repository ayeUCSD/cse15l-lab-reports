Dear diary,

This lab, I had an absolutely frustrating time logging in to the SSH. In fact, as of writing now, I STILL cannot log in. Luckilly, one of the tutors let me use their login so I could at least try some of the lab.


What we went over:
- vs code
- our cse15l Account!
- connecting to an ssh 
- some command line... commands
- moving files with command scp
- ssh keys
-
